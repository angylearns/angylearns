            <br><br>
            I entered the tech world during the pandemic, and since then, I haven't stopped. I obtained a professional certificate in web application development, programmed my first app, and got my first job as a developer. 
            <br><br>
            I'm currently immersed in my education and professional development. I <strong>love</strong> learning, and I'm always studying. </section><br><br>
